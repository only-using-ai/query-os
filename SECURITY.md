## GUI Feature Security Analysis

### Potential Security Risks

#### 1. Arbitrary File System Access
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Description**: The GUI allows execution of arbitrary SQL-like queries that can access any part of the filesystem. While this is the intended functionality, it could be abused if the application is run with elevated privileges or if users execute unintended queries.
**Mitigation Required**: User education, clear warnings about query effects, read-only mode option.

#### 2. Template Path Traversal
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: Template loading and saving uses file paths that could potentially be manipulated for path traversal attacks if template names contain ".." or absolute paths.
**Mitigation Required**: Validate template names, ensure they only contain safe characters, prevent absolute paths.

#### 3. Information Disclosure Through Error Messages
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Description**: Error messages in the GUI status bar could potentially leak system information through file paths or error details.
**Mitigation Required**: Sanitize error messages to prevent information leakage.

#### 4. Resource Exhaustion from GUI
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: Large result sets displayed in the GUI table could consume excessive memory, especially with filesystem queries returning many files.
**Mitigation Required**: Implement result set pagination or limits for GUI display.

### Recommended Security Controls

- [x] Error message sanitization implemented

## GUI Modernization Security Analysis

### Potential Security Risks from UI Changes

#### 1. Information Disclosure Through Result Display
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Description**: The GUI now properly filters columns based on SELECT statements, reducing the risk of accidental information disclosure. However, users could still execute broad queries that display sensitive filesystem information.
**Mitigation Required**: User education about query effects, consider adding query preview or confirmation for potentially sensitive queries.

#### 2. Resource Exhaustion from Large Result Sets
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: GUI displays all query results without pagination, potentially causing memory exhaustion with large directory listings or process queries.
**Mitigation Required**: Implement result set limits or pagination in GUI display.

#### 3. Loading State Information Leakage
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Description**: The animated spinner and "Executing..." status could potentially be used for timing attacks to infer query complexity or system load.
**Mitigation Required**: Consider uniform loading times or generic loading messages.

### Security Controls for GUI Features

1. **Query Result Filtering**: Column selection is properly enforced, preventing unintended data exposure
2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs still go through the existing parser validation
3. **Error Handling**: Error messages remain sanitized and don't leak system information

## GUI Modernization Task 16 Security Analysis

### Potential Security Risks from Task 16 Changes

#### 1. Information Disclosure Through Enhanced Table Display
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Description**: The modern table styling with improved visual design and sorting functionality could potentially make sensitive data more readable or accessible. The enhanced UI might encourage users to explore more data than they otherwise would.
**Mitigation Required**: No additional mitigation needed beyond existing column filtering and access controls.

#### 2. Resource Exhaustion from Sorting Large Datasets
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: The new column sorting functionality could consume excessive CPU and memory when sorting very large result sets, potentially leading to DoS conditions if the GUI is processing many concurrent queries.
**Mitigation Required**: Consider implementing result set size limits for sorting operations.

#### 3. User Interface Timing Attacks
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Description**: The animated spinner and loading states could potentially be used for timing analysis of query complexity, though this is largely mitigated by the asynchronous query execution.
**Mitigation Required**: No additional mitigation needed.

### Security Controls for Task 16 Features

1. **Sorting Security**: Column sorting operates only on already-retrieved and filtered data, maintaining existing security boundaries
2. **UI State Management**: Sorting state is reset on each new query, preventing persistent state-based attacks
3. **Input Validation**: All sorting interactions go through the existing validated message handling system
4. **Memory Safety**: Sorting uses Rust's safe comparison operations, preventing buffer overflows or memory corruption

### Current Implementation Status for Task 16
- [x] Modern table styling doesn't introduce security risks
- [x] Column sorting maintains data security boundaries
- [x] Spinner animation is cosmetic only
- [ ] Consider result size limits for sorting performance
- [x] No new attack vectors introduced

## Task 18 Features Security Analysis

### Potential Security Risks from Task 18 Changes

#### 1. Keyboard Shortcut Security Concerns
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Description**: The addition of Cmd+Enter/Ctrl+Enter keyboard shortcuts for query execution could potentially allow accidental or unintended query execution if users accidentally trigger the shortcut while editing queries. This is particularly concerning for DELETE operations which could cause data loss.
**Mitigation Required**: Consider adding confirmation dialogs for destructive operations or visual feedback when shortcuts are used.

#### 2. Right-Click Context Menu Process Killing
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Description**: The right-click context menu allows direct process termination without confirmation. This could lead to:
- Accidental termination of critical system processes
- Potential for privilege escalation if the application runs with elevated privileges
- System instability from killing essential processes
**Mitigation Required**: Add confirmation dialog before process termination, validate process ownership/permissions, consider limiting to user-owned processes only.

#### 3. Automatic Query Generation for Process Deletion
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: When right-clicking a process, the system automatically generates and executes a DELETE query. This bypasses normal query review and could execute unintended operations if the PID extraction is incorrect or if the UI state becomes corrupted.
**Mitigation Required**: Validate PID format, add confirmation dialog, ensure query generation is secure and predictable.

#### 4. UI State Management Security
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Description**: The right-click functionality introduces new UI state handling that could potentially be manipulated if there are race conditions or state corruption issues.
**Mitigation Required**: Ensure proper state validation and error handling in the right-click message processing.

### Security Controls for Task 18 Features

1. **Process Termination Authorization**: Validate user permissions before allowing process termination
2. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Require explicit confirmation for destructive operations
3. **Input Validation**: Validate PID format and ensure it's numeric and reasonable
4. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages without information leakage
5. **Audit Logging**: Log all process termination attempts for security monitoring
6. **Shortcut Safety**: Consider requiring focus in query editor for shortcut activation

### Recommended Security Controls

1. **Process Killing Confirmation**: Display a confirmation dialog showing process details before termination
2. **PID Validation**: Ensure PID is numeric, positive, and within valid ranges
3. **User Process Filtering**: Consider limiting process termination to user-owned processes
4. **Shortcut Confirmation**: Add visual feedback or confirmation for keyboard shortcuts on DELETE queries
5. **Error Recovery**: Provide clear error messages and recovery options if process killing fails

### Current Implementation Status for Task 18
- [x] Confirmation dialog for process termination implemented
- [x] PID validation through existing query parsing
- [ ] User permission checks for process termination (inherited from sysinfo)
- [ ] Audit logging for process operations (logged via status messages)
- [x] Visual feedback for keyboard shortcuts on DELETE queries
- [x] Error handling for failed process termination (inherited from existing error handling)

## Network/Port Querying Feature Security Analysis

### Potential Security Risks

#### 1. Command Injection and PATH Manipulation
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: The network querying feature executes external system commands (lsof, ss, netstat) to gather network information. While no user input is directly passed to these commands, a compromised PATH environment variable could allow execution of malicious commands instead of the intended network utilities.
**Mitigation Required**: Use absolute paths for system commands, validate command existence before execution, implement command allowlisting.

#### 2. Information Disclosure of Network Services
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: Network queries expose process names, port numbers, and process IDs for all network services running on the system. This could reveal:
- Running web servers or databases
- Internal service ports
- Process ownership information
- Potential attack surface information
**Mitigation Required**: Consider access controls, user warnings about information disclosure, document that this reveals system network state.

#### 3. Privilege Escalation Through Network Commands
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Description**: Network introspection commands often require elevated privileges (especially on Linux with ss/netstat). If the application is run with elevated privileges, network queries could be used to:
- Enumerate all network connections including those of other users
- Reveal sensitive network communication patterns
- Potentially access privileged network information
**Mitigation Required**: Document privilege requirements, recommend running with minimal privileges, consider user permission validation.

#### 4. Resource Exhaustion from Network Enumeration
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Description**: Systems with many network connections could cause:
- Large result sets consuming memory
- Command execution timeouts
- Performance degradation during network scans
**Mitigation Required**: Implement result set limits, command timeouts, graceful degradation when commands fail.

#### 5. Cross-Platform Command Security Differences
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: Different platforms use different commands with potentially different security implications:
- macOS: lsof (generally safe, requires minimal privileges)
- Linux: ss/netstat (may require elevated privileges)
- Windows: netstat (different privilege model)
**Mitigation Required**: Platform-specific security documentation, privilege requirement warnings.

### Recommended Security Controls

1. **Command Security**: Use absolute paths when possible, validate command availability, implement timeouts
2. **Information Disclosure Warnings**: Display clear warnings about network information exposure
3. **Privilege Documentation**: Document required privileges for different platforms
4. **Result Limiting**: Implement maximum result set sizes for network queries
5. **Error Handling**: Generic error messages to prevent information leakage about system state
6. **Audit Logging**: Log network queries for security monitoring

### Current Implementation Status
- [x] Cross-platform command fallback implemented (lsof/ss/netstat)
- [ ] Absolute paths not used for commands (uses PATH lookup)
- [ ] Privilege requirement warnings not implemented
- [x] Basic error handling for command failures
- [ ] Result set limits not implemented
- [ ] Information disclosure warnings not shown to users

## Extension Column Feature Security Analysis

### Potential Security Risks from Extension Column Addition

#### 1. Information Disclosure Through Extension Enumeration
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Description**: The extension column provides additional filesystem metadata that could be used for:
- Identifying file types and software installations
- Fingerprinting system configuration through file extension patterns
- Revealing development tools or application usage patterns
**Mitigation Required**: No additional mitigation needed beyond existing filesystem access controls.

#### 2. Extension Parsing Edge Cases
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Description**: The extension extraction logic handles various edge cases (files starting with dots, multiple dots, empty extensions). While the current implementation is safe, malformed filenames could potentially cause unexpected behavior in extension parsing.
**Mitigation Required**: Extension parsing is purely string-based with bounds checking, no security risks identified.

#### 3. NULL Extension Handling
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Description**: Files and directories without extensions are represented as NULL values. This could potentially be used in queries to identify files without extensions, though this is benign information.
**Mitigation Required**: NULL handling is consistent and safe, no additional controls needed.

#### 4. Case Conversion for Sorting/Filter Consistency
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Description**: Extensions are converted to lowercase for consistent sorting and filtering. This string manipulation is safe and doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities.
**Mitigation Required**: Case conversion uses standard Rust string methods, no security concerns.

### Security Controls for Extension Column Features

1. **Safe String Processing**: Extension extraction uses only standard string operations with proper bounds checking
2. **No External Resource Access**: Extension parsing operates only on filename strings, no file I/O or external commands
3. **Consistent NULL Handling**: NULL values are safely handled in filtering, sorting, and display operations
4. **Input Validation**: Extension extraction includes validation to prevent out-of-bounds access

### Current Implementation Status for Extension Column
- [x] Safe extension extraction with bounds checking
- [x] Proper NULL handling for directories and extensionless files
- [x] Case-insensitive operations for consistency
- [x] No external dependencies or unsafe operations
- [x] Comprehensive unit testing for edge cases
- [x] No new attack vectors introduced
